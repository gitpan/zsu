NAME
    zsu - update serial numbers in DNS zone files

SYNOPSIS
    zsu [-cdfhLnv] zone ...

DESCRIPTION
    After any changes are made to a DNS zone file, the serial number
    must be increased -- otherwise changes will not propagate to
    the slave servers (secondaries).  zsu handles the serial number
    update automatically, while preserving everything else in the file.
    Full documentation is included in pod format, 'pod2text zsu' will
    display it.
